# weatherApp

This app will allow a user to enter a city name and obtain current weather conditions along with a 5 day forecast.  This app will save search history in buttons
labeled with the name of the city searched.  When the buttons are clicked another api call will go out for that city which will display current and 5 day weather
information.  The uv index has a blue background color for low, yellow for medium and red for high.
